# A simple magic trick with jQuery

You will need a text-editor and a browser to code this magic trick. I like to use Atom and Google Chrome. If you don't have these installed let one of us know and we will help you.

Start by downloading the these files to your desktop. (See the "Download ZIP" button to the top-right? Click that.)

Once you have the files downloaded, open "index.html" in Atom and we'll get started!
